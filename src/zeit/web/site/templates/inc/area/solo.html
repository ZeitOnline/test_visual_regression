Display mobile ad place 3 in zon on homepage after the first module that's not a raw element, assuming for now:
- that the first element on a homepage is always a solo area (as offered by @jpfn)
- that there will be only ONE raw element at the start of the first region (like olympia navigation)
- that the raw contains navigational elements and the ad should be placed after the first teaser, not the raw itself
